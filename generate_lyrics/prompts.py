general_tips = """
- Do not put any symbols in the lyrics.
- The lyrics must make sense and be clear instead of just repeating key words. Do not make the lyrics too catchy that it doesn't make sense.
- The lyrics should be in hiragana and katakana unless the kanji is very easy and obvious how to read it.
- DO NOT make the lyrics too poetic or use too difficult words, focus on clarity and ease of learning.
